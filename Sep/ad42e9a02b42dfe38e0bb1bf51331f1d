Minister of Human Settlements, Water & Sanitation, the Honourable Lindiwe Sisulu will address the Social Housing Regulatory Authority (SHRA) Investment Seminar taking place virtually this coming Wednesday, 30 September 2020 highlighting the strategic role of social housing in the Human Settlements portfolio.   The aim of this seminar is to communicate opportunities for partnerships with the SHRA aimed at investment in social housing infrastructure in order to rebuild our country’s economy ensuring that no-one is left behind. This important Stakeholder Seminar is aimed at potential investors, developers and contractors who are able to partner with the SHRA by either funding projects or proposing projects; government departments dealing with infrastructure development or funding; as well as National Treasury. In order to achieve the target of 30 0000 housing units by the end of the Medium-Term Strategic Framework (MTSF), the SHRA must have investors, including funders and delivery partners, on board that believe in the social housing mandate.
