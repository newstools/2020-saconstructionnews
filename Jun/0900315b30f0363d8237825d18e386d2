With the aim of celebrating and encouraging women in the construction industry, the Construction Industry Development Board (cidb) has developed an awards programme to showcase their projects and achievements.  The Empowerment and Recognition of Women in Construction (ERWIC) Awards consist of ten awards categories, which are open for entry to any entity which is registered with the cidb and is at least 51% female-owned. The awards also recognise clients, entities and individuals who support gender transformation and mentorship of women within the industry. Entries are open on the 15th June with winners named during Women’s Month in August.   Traditionally a male-dominated industry, the construction industry has seen a great evolution over the past few years. Today, women are increasingly assuming positions once considered ‘male’ roles, overcoming outdated stereotypes. Enterprise development and empowerment of this emerging sector is core to the cidb’s strategy for growth and development of the construction industry. The cidb has identified women as a critical target for development and has chosen to celebrate and encourage this group through the ERWIC Awards process.
