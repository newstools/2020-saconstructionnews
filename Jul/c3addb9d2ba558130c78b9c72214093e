 Auditor-general (AG), Kimi Makwetu states in the report that there are limited resources across all provinces, however, no proper care is applied to manage and spend diligently. “The safe and clean hands that can be relied upon to look after the public’s finances in local government are few and far between,” he states.    However, it’s not all bad news for our municipalities. Consulting Engineers South Africa (CESA) CEO, Chris Campbell highlights that CESA has stepped up to the plate in recent years to assist and advise municipalities on sounder and more effective project procurement, planning and implementation processes. “It is widely understood that there is a skills disparity at government level, meaning a lack of sufficient expertise when it comes to navigating the complexities of public infrastructure development processes,” says Campbell. “CESA has been building on our partnership with government to equip the Department of Public Works and Infrastructure with the necessary skills and capacity to improve service delivery – specifically for the kinds of municipal projects mentioned in the AG’s report,” he explains.
