 Businesses are having to consider how to get back into action while still ensuring health and safety is kept top of mind.    “The built environment sector is one such industry which has been given greater freedom to operate,” says Consulting Engineers South Africa (CESA) CEO, Chris Campbell. While 'critical public works construction' was still allowed under level five, 'other public works civil engineering projects' have been permitted under level four. “In returning to work, it can’t be business as usual,” said Minister of Employment and Labour, Thulas Nxesi. Campbell comments: “As Minister Nxesi said, we must embrace ‘business unusual’ and ensure we adhere to the strictest health and safety precautions as some individuals return to work.”
